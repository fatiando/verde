Code of conduct
+++++++++++++++

Please note that this project is released with a
`Contributor Code of Conduct <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

Contributing Guidelines

Please read our

to see how you can help and give feedback.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equality important contributions include:
writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the
contribution process).
If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from
those mistakes.
That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
