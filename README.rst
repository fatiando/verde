About
-----

Verde is a Python library for processing spatial data (bathymetry, geophysics
surveys, etc) and interpolating it on regular grids (i.e., *gridding*).

Most gridding methods in Verde use a Green's functions approach.
A linear model is estimated based on the input data and then used to predict
data on a regular grid (or in a scatter, a profile, as derivatives).
The models are Green's functions from (mostly) elastic deformation theory.
This approach is very similar to *machine learning* so we implement gridder
classes that are similar to `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`__
regression classes.
The API is not 100% compatible but it should look familiar to those with some
scikit-learn experience.

Advantages of using Green's functions include:

* Easily apply **weights** to data points. This is a linear least-squares
  problem.
* Perform **model selection** using established machine learning techniques,
  like k-fold or holdout cross-validation.
* The estimated model can be **easily stored** for later use, like
  spherical-harmonic coefficients are used in gravimetry.

The main disadvantage is the heavy memory and processing time requirement (it's a linear
regression problem). So it's not recommended for gridding large datasets (> 10,000
points), though it will depend on how much RAM you have available.


Project goals
-------------

* Provide a machine-learning inspired interface for gridding spatial data
* Integration with the Scipy stack: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and xarray
* Include common processing and data preparation tasks, like blocked means and 2D trends
* Support for gridding scalar and vector data (like wind speed or GPS velocities)
* Support for both Cartesian and geographic coordinates

The first release of Verde was focused on meeting these initial goals and establishing
the look and feel of the library. Later releases will focus on expanding the range of
gridders available, optimizing the code, and improving algorithms so that
larger-than-memory datasets can also be supported.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equality important contributions include:
writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the
contribution process).
If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from
those mistakes.
That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
