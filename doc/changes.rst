**DEPRECATIONS** (the following features are deprecated and will be removed in
Verde v2.0.0):

* Functions and the associated sample dataset
  ``verde.datasets.fetch_rio_magnetic`` and
  ``verde.datasets.setup_rio_magnetic_map`` are deprecated. Please use another
  dataset instead.
  (`#213 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/213>`__)
* Class ``verde.VectorSpline2D`` is deprecated. The class is specific for
  GPS/GNSS data and doesn't fit the general-purpose nature of Verde. The
  implementation will be moved to the `Erizo
  <https://github.com/fatiando/erizo>`__ package instead.
  (`#214 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/214>`__)
* The ``client`` keyword argument for ``verde.cross_val_score`` and
  ``verde.SplineCV`` is deprecated in favor of the new ``delayed`` argument
  (see below).
  (`#222 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/222>`__)

New features:

* Use the ``dask.delayed`` interface for parallelism in cross-validation
  instead of the futures interface (``dask.distributed.Client``). It's easier
  and allows building the entire graph lazily before executing. To use the new
  feature, pass ``delayed=True`` to ``verde.cross_val_score`` and
  ``verde.SplineCV``. The argument ``client`` in both of these is deprecated
  (see above).
  (`#222 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/222>`__)
* Expose the optimal spline in ``verde.SplineCV.spline_``. This is the fitted
  ``verde.Spline`` object using the optimal parameters.
  (`#219 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/219>`__)
* New option ``drop_coords`` to allow ``verde.BlockReduce`` and
  ``verde.BlockMean`` to reduce extra elements in ``coordinates`` (basically,
  treat them as data). Default to ``True`` to maintain backwards compatibility.
  If ``False``, will no longer drop coordinates after the second one but will
  apply the reduction in blocks to them as well. The reduced coordinates are
  returned in the same order in the ``coordinates``.
  (`#198 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/198>`__)

Improvements:

* Use the default system cache location to store the sample data instead of
  ``~/.verde/data``. This is so users can more easily clean up unused files.
  Because this is system specific, function ``verde.datasets.locate`` was added
  to return the cache folder location.
  (`#220 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/220>`__)

Bug fixes:

* Correctly use ``parallel=True`` and ``numba.prange`` in the numba compiled
  functions. Using it on the Green's function was raising a warning because
  there is nothing to parallelize.
  (`#221 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/221>`__)

Maintenance:

* Add testing and support for Python 3.8.
  (`#211 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/211>`__)

Documentation:

* Fix a typo in the JOSS paper Bibtex entry.
  (`#215 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/215>`__)
* Wrap docstrings to 79 characters for better integration with Jupyter and
  IPython. These systems display docstrings using 80 character windows, causing
  our larger lines to wrap around and become almost illegible.
  (`#212 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/212>`__)
* Use napoleon instead of numpydoc to format docstrings. Results is slightly
  different layout in the website documentation.
  (`#209 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/209>`__)
* Update contact information to point to the Slack chat instead of Gitter.
  (`#204 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/204>`__)

Version 1.2.0
-------------

*Released on: 2019/07/23*

.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3347076.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3347076

Bug fixes:

* Return the correct coordinates when passing ``pixel_register=True`` and ``shape`` to
  ``verde.grid_coordinates``. The returned coordinates had 1 too few elements in each
  dimension (and the wrong values). This is because we generate grid-line registered
  points first and then shift them to the center of the pixels and drop the last point.
  This only works when specifying ``spacing`` because it will generate the right amount
  of points. When ``shape`` is given, we need to first convert it to "grid-line" shape
  (with 1 extra point per dimension) before generating coordinates.
  (`#183 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/183>`__)
* Reset force coordinates when refitting splines. Previously, the splines set the force
  coordinates from the data coordinates only the first time ``fit`` was called. This
  means that when fitting on different data, the spline would still use the old
  coordinates leading to a poor prediction score. Now, the spline will use the
  coordinates of the current data passed to ``fit``. This only affects cases where
  ``force_coords=None``. It's a slight change and only affects some of the scores for
  cross-validation. (`#191 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/191>`__)

New functions/classes:

* New class ``verde.SplineCV``: a cross-validated version of ``Spline`` . that performs
  grid search cross-validation to automatically tune the parameters of a ``Spline``.
  (`#185 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/185>`__)
* New function ``verde.longitude_continuity`` to format longitudes to a continuous
  range so that they can be indexed with ``verde.inside``
  (`#181 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/181>`__)
* New function ``verde.load_surfer`` to load grid data from a Surfer ASCII file (a
  contouring, griding and surface mapping software from GoldenSoftware).
  (`#169 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/169>`__)
* New function ``verde.median_distance`` that calculates the median near neighbor
  distance between each point in the given dataset.
  (`#163 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/163>`__)

Improvements:

* Allow ``verde.block_split`` and ``verde.BlockReduce`` to take a ``shape`` argument
  instead of ``spacing``. Useful when the size of the block is less meaningful than the
  number of blocks.
  (`#184 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/184>`__)
* Allow zero degree polynomials in ``verde.Trend``, which represents a mean value.
  (`#162 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/162>`__)
* Function ``verde.cross_val_score`` returns a numpy array instead of a list for easier
  computations on the results. (`#160 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/160>`__)
* Function ``verde.maxabs`` now handles inputs with NaNs automatically.
  (`#158 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/158>`__)

Documentation:

* New tutorial to explain the intricacies of grid coordinates generation, adjusting
  spacing vs region, pixel registration, etc.
  (`#192 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/192>`__)

Maintenance:

* Drop support for Python 3.5. (`#178 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/178>`__)
* Add support for Python 3.7. (`#150 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/150>`__)
* More functions are now part of the base API: ``n_1d_arrays``, ``check_fit_input`` and
  ``least_squares`` are now included in ``verde.base``.

Version 1.1.0
-------------

*Released on: 2018/11/06*

.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1478245.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1478245

New features:

* **New** ``verde.grid_to_table`` function that converts grids to xyz tables with the
  coordinate and data values for each grid point
  (`#148 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/148>`__)
* Add an ``extra_coords`` option to coordinate generators (``grid_coordinates``,
  ``scatter_points``, and ``profile_coordinates``) to specify a constant value to be
  used as an extra coordinate (`#145 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/145>`__)
* Allow gridders to pass extra keyword arguments (``**kwargs``) for the coordinate
  generator functions (`#144 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/144>`__)

Improvements:

* Don't use the Jacobian matrix for predictions to avoid memory overloads. Use dedicated
  and numba wrapped functions instead. As a consequence, predictions are also a bit
  faster when numba is installed (`#149 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/149>`__)
* Set the default ``n_splits=5`` when using ``KFold`` from scikit-learn
  (`#143 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/143>`__)

Bug fixes:

* Use the xarray grid's pcolormesh method instead of matplotlib to plot grids in the
  examples. The xarray method takes care of shifting the pixels by half a spacing when
  grids are not pixel registered (`#151 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/151>`__)

* Paper submission to JOSS (`#134 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/134>`__). This
  is the new default citation for Verde.
* Remove default ``shape`` for the ``grid`` method (`#140 <https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/140>`__).
  There is no reason to have one and it wasn't even implemented in ``grid_coordinates``.
