        A random number generator used to define the state of the random

    Generate the coordinates for each point on a regular grid.

    The grid can be specified by either the number of points in each dimension (the
    *shape*) or by the grid node spacing.

    If the given region is not divisible by the desired spacing, either the region or
    the spacing will have to be adjusted. By default, the spacing will be rounded to the
    nearest multiple. Optionally, the East and North boundaries of the region can be
    adjusted to fit the exact spacing given. See the examples below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    region : list = [W, E, S, N]
        The boundaries of a given region in Cartesian or geographic coordinates.
    shape : tuple = (n_north, n_east) or None
        The number of points in the South-North and West-East directions, respectively.
    spacing : float, tuple = (s_north, s_east), or None
        The grid spacing in the South-North and West-East directions, respectively. A
        single value means that the spacing is equal in both directions.
    adjust : {'spacing', 'region'}
        Whether to adjust the spacing or the region if required. Ignored if *shape* is
        given instead of *spacing*. Defaults to adjusting the spacing.
    pixel_register : bool
        If True, the coordinates will refer to the center of each grid pixel instead of
        the grid lines. In practice, this means that there will be one less element per
        dimension of the grid when compared to grid line registered (only if given
        *spacing* and not *shape*). Default is False.
    extra_coords : None, scalar, or list
        If not None, then value(s) of extra coordinate arrays to be generated. These
        extra arrays will have the same *shape* as the others but will contain a
        constant value. Will generate an extra array per value given in *extra_coords*.
        Use this to generate arrays of constant heights or times, for example, that

        Arrays with coordinates of each point in the grid. Each array contains values
        for a dimension in the order: easting, northing, vertical, and any extra
        dimensions given in *extra_coords*. All arrays will have the specified *shape*.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(0, 5, 0, 10), shape=(5, 3))
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (5, 3) (5, 3)
    >>> # Lower printing precision to shorten this example
    >>> import numpy as np; np.set_printoptions(precision=1, suppress=True)
    >>> print(east)

     [ 5.   5.   5. ]
     [ 7.5  7.5  7.5]
     [10.  10.  10. ]]

    The grid can also be specified using the spacing between points instead of the
    shape:

    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(0, 5, 0, 10), spacing=2.5)
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (5, 3) (5, 3)
    >>> print(east)
    [[0.  2.5 5. ]
     [0.  2.5 5. ]

     [ 5.   5.   5. ]
     [ 7.5  7.5  7.5]
     [10.  10.  10. ]]

    The spacing can be different for northing and easting, respectively:

    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(-5, 1, 0, 10), spacing=(2.5, 1))
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (5, 7) (5, 7)
    >>> print(east)
    [[-5. -4. -3. -2. -1.  0.  1.]
     [-5. -4. -3. -2. -1.  0.  1.]
     [-5. -4. -3. -2. -1.  0.  1.]
     [-5. -4. -3. -2. -1.  0.  1.]
     [-5. -4. -3. -2. -1.  0.  1.]]
    >>> print(north)

     [10.  10.  10.  10.  10.  10.  10. ]]

    If the region can't be divided into the desired spacing, the spacing will be
    adjusted to conform to the region:

    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(-5, 0, 0, 5), spacing=2.6)
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (3, 3) (3, 3)
    >>> print(east)
    [[-5.  -2.5  0. ]
     [-5.  -2.5  0. ]
     [-5.  -2.5  0. ]]
    >>> print(north)
    [[0.  0.  0. ]
     [2.5 2.5 2.5]
     [5.  5.  5. ]]
    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(-5, 0, 0, 5), spacing=2.4)
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (3, 3) (3, 3)
    >>> print(east)
    [[-5.  -2.5  0. ]
     [-5.  -2.5  0. ]
     [-5.  -2.5  0. ]]
    >>> print(north)
    [[0.  0.  0. ]
     [2.5 2.5 2.5]
     [5.  5.  5. ]]

    You can choose to adjust the East and North boundaries of the region instead:

    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(-5, 0, 0, 5), spacing=2.6,
    ...                                adjust='region')
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (3, 3) (3, 3)
    >>> print(east)
    [[-5.  -2.4  0.2]
     [-5.  -2.4  0.2]
     [-5.  -2.4  0.2]]
    >>> print(north)
    [[0.  0.  0. ]
     [2.6 2.6 2.6]
     [5.2 5.2 5.2]]
    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(-5, 0, 0, 5), spacing=2.4,
    ...                                adjust='region')
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (3, 3) (3, 3)
    >>> print(east)
    [[-5.  -2.6 -0.2]
     [-5.  -2.6 -0.2]
     [-5.  -2.6 -0.2]]
    >>> print(north)
    [[0.  0.  0. ]
     [2.4 2.4 2.4]
     [4.8 4.8 4.8]]

    We can optionally generate coordinates for the center of each grid pixel instead of
    the corner (default):

    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(0, 5, 0, 10), spacing=2.5,
    ...                                pixel_register=True)
    >>> # Raise the printing precision for this example
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True)
    >>> # Notice that the shape is 1 less than when pixel_register=False
    >>> print(east.shape, north.shape)
    (4, 2) (4, 2)
    >>> print(east)
    [[1.25 3.75]
     [1.25 3.75]
     [1.25 3.75]
     [1.25 3.75]]
    >>> print(north)
    [[1.25 1.25]
     [3.75 3.75]
     [6.25 6.25]
     [8.75 8.75]]
    >>> east, north = grid_coordinates(region=(0, 5, 0, 10), shape=(4, 2),
    ...                                pixel_register=True)
    >>> print(east)
    [[1.25 3.75]
     [1.25 3.75]
     [1.25 3.75]
     [1.25 3.75]]
    >>> print(north)
    [[1.25 1.25]
     [3.75 3.75]
     [6.25 6.25]
     [8.75 8.75]]

    point2 : tuple or list
        ``(easting, northing)`` West-East and South-North coordinates of the
        second point, respectively.
    size : int
        Number of points to sample along the line.
    extra_coords : None, scalar, or list
        If not None, then value(s) of extra coordinate arrays to be generated. These
        extra arrays will have the same *size* as the others but will contain a
        constant value. Will generate an extra array per value given in *extra_coords*.
        Use this to generate arrays of constant heights or times, for example, that
        might be needed to evaluate a gridder.

    Returns
    -------
    coordinates, distances : tuple and 1d array
        The coordinates of points along the straight line and the distances from the
        first point.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Arrays with the coordinates of each data point. Should be in the

def block_split(coordinates, spacing, adjust="spacing", region=None):
    """
    Split a region into blocks and label points according to where they fall.

    The labels are integers corresponding to the index of the block. The same
    index is used for the coordinates of each block.

    .. note::

        If installed, package ``pykdtree`` will be used instead of
        :class:`scipy.spatial.cKDTree` for better performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : tuple of arrays
        Arrays with the coordinates of each data point. Should be in the
        following order: (easting, northing, vertical, ...). Only easting and
        northing will be used, all subsequent coordinates will be ignored.
    spacing : float, tuple = (s_north, s_east), or None
        The block size in the South-North and West-East directions,
        respectively. A single value means that the size is equal in both
        directions.
    adjust : {'spacing', 'region'}
        Whether to adjust the spacing or the region if required. Ignored if
        *shape* is given instead of *spacing*. Defaults to adjusting the
        spacing.
    region : list = [W, E, S, N]
        The boundaries of a given region in Cartesian or geographic
        coordinates. If not region is given, will use the bounding region of
        the given points.

    Returns
    -------
    block_coordinates : tuple of arrays
        (easting, northing) arrays with the coordinates of the center of each
        block.
    labels : array
        integer label for each data point. The label is the index of the block
        to which that point belongs.
