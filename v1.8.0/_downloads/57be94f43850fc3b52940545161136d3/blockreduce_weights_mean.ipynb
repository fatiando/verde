        "\n# Using weights in blocked means\n\n:class:`verde.BlockReduce` is not able to output weights because we need to\nmake assumptions about the reduction operation to know how to propagate\nuncertainties or calculated weighted variances. That's why verde provides\nspecialized reductions like :class:`verde.BlockMean`, which can calculate\nweights from input data in three ways:\n\n1. Using the variance of the data. This is the only possible option when no\n   weights are provided.\n2. Using the uncertainty of the weighted mean propagated from the uncertainties\n   in the data. In this case, we assume that the weights are\n   ``1/uncertainty**2``.\n3. Using the weighted variance of the data.\n\nUsing the propagated uncertainties may be more adequate if your data is smooth\nin each block (low variance) but have very different uncertainties. The\npropagation preserves a low weight for data that have large uncertainties but\ndon't vary much inside the block.\n\nThe weighted variance should be used when the data vary a lot in each block\n(high variance) but have very similar uncertainties. The variance will be large\nwhen there is a lot of variability in the data that isn't due to the\nuncertainties. This is also the best choice if your data weights aren't\n``1/uncertainty**2``.\n"
