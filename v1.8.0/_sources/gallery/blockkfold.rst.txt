K-Fold cross-validation with blocks
===================================

Cross-validation scores for spatial data can be biased because observations are
commonly spatially autocorrelated (closer data points have similar values). One
strategy to reduce the bias is to split data along spatial blocks
[Roberts_etal2017]_. Verde offers the cross-validator
:class:`verde.BlockKFold`, which is a scikit-learn compatible version of k-fold
cross-validation using spatial blocks.

When splitting the data into training and testing sets,
:class:`~verde.BlockKFold` first splits the data into spatial blocks and then
splits the blocks into folds. During k-fold cross-validation, one fold is used
as the testing set while the rest are used for training. Since each block can
have a different number of data points, assigning the same number of blocks to
each fold can lead to folds with very different numbers of data points.
By default, :class:`~verde.BlockKFold` takes care to balance the folds to have
approximately equal number of data points.
Alternatively, you can turn off balancing to have each fold contain the same
number of blocks.

This example shows the data assigned to each of the first 3 folds of a blocked
k-fold iteration, with and without balancing. Notice that the unbalanced folds
have very different numbers of data points.
