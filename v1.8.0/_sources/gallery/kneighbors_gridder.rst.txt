Gridding with a nearest-neighbors interpolator
==============================================

Verde offers the :class:`verde.KNeighbors` class for nearest-neighbor gridding.
The interpolation looks at the data values of the *k* nearest neighbors of a
interpolated point. If *k* is 1, then the data value of the closest neighbor is
assigned to the point. If *k* is greater than 1, the average value of the
closest *k* neighbors is assigned to the point.

The interpolation works on Cartesian data, so if we want to grid geographic
data (like our Baja California bathymetry) we need to project them into a
Cartesian system. We'll use `pyproj <https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj>`__ to
calculate a Mercator projection for the data.

For convenience, Verde still allows us to make geographic grids by passing the
``projection`` argument to :meth:`verde.KNeighbors.grid` and the like. When
doing so, the grid will be generated using geographic coordinates which will be
projected prior to interpolation.
