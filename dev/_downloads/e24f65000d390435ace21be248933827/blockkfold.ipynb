        "\n# K-Fold cross-validation with blocks\n\nCross-validation scores for spatial data can be biased because observations are\ncommonly spatially autocorrelated (closer data points have similar values). One\nstrategy to reduce the bias is to split data along spatial blocks\n[Roberts_etal2017]_. Verde offers the cross-validator\n:class:`verde.BlockKFold`, which is a scikit-learn compatible version of k-fold\ncross-validation using spatial blocks.\n\nWhen splitting the data into training and testing sets,\n:class:`~verde.BlockKFold` first splits the data into spatial blocks and then\nsplits the blocks into folds. During k-fold cross-validation, one fold is used\nas the testing set while the rest are used for training. Since each block can\nhave a different number of data points, assigning the same number of blocks to\neach fold can lead to folds with very different numbers of data points.\nBy default, :class:`~verde.BlockKFold` takes care to balance the folds to have\napproximately equal number of data points.\nAlternatively, you can turn off balancing to have each fold contain the same\nnumber of blocks.\n\nThis example shows the data assigned to each of the first 3 folds of a blocked\nk-fold iteration, with and without balancing. Notice that the unbalanced folds\nhave very different numbers of data points.\n"
